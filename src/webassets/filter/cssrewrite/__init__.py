class CSSRewrite(CSSUrlRewriter):
    """Source filter that rewrites relative urls in CSS files.

    CSS allows you to specify urls relative to the location of the CSS file.
    However, you may want to store your compressed assets in a different place
    than source files, or merge source files from different locations. This
    would then break these relative CSS references, since the base URL changed.

    This filter transparently rewrites CSS ``url()`` instructions in the source
    files to make them relative to the location of the output path. It works as
    a *source filter*, i.e. it is applied individually to each source file
    before they are merged.

    No configuration is necessary.

    The filter also supports a manual mode::

        get_filter('cssrewrite', replace={'old_directory':'/custom/path/'})

    This will rewrite all urls that point to files within ``old_directory`` to
    use ``/custom/path`` as a prefix instead.

    You may plug in your own replace function:
        get_filter('cssrewrite', replace=lambda url: re.sub(r'^/?images/', '/images/', url))
        get_filter('cssrewrite', replace=lambda url: '/images/'+url[7:] if url.startswith('images/') else url)

    # MEDIA_URL.
