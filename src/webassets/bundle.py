    Bundles can be nested arbitrarily.

    A note on the connection between a bundle and an "environment"
    instance: The bundle requires a environment that it belongs to.
    Without an environment, it lacks information about how to behave,
    and cannot know where relative paths are actually based.
    However, I don't want to make the Bundle.__init__ syntax more
    complicated than it already is by requiring an Environment object
    to be passed. This would be a particular nuisance when nested
    bundles are used. Further, nested bundles are never explicitly
    connected to an Environment, and what's more, the same child
    bundle can be used in multiple parent bundles.

    This is the reason why basically every method of the Bundle
    class takes an ``env`` parameter - so a parent bundle can provide
    the environment for child bundles that do not know it.
