    Bundles can be nested arbitrarily.

    A note on the connection between a bundle and an "environment" instance:
    The bundle requires a environment that it belongs to. Without an
    environment, it lacks information about how to behave, and cannot know
    where relative paths are actually based. However, I don't want to make the
    ``Bundle.__init__`` syntax more complicated than it already is by requiring
    an Environment object to be passed. This would be a particular nuisance
    when nested bundles are used. Further, nested bundles are never explicitly
    connected to an Environment, and what's more, the same child bundle can be
    used in multiple parent bundles.

    This is the reason why basically every method of the Bundle class takes an
    ``env`` parameter - so a parent bundle can provide the environment for
    child bundles that do not know it.

          syntax error to mix both positive and negative matches.
          Examples:

          default inlining mode of each renderer. Note, however, that
          this can be overridden then on a per-renderer basis.

        * `default` : str, optional, default: null

          If specified (and not ``None``), this will be used as the
          value to the `default` parameter to each `render()` call.
          Note, however, that this can be overridden then on a
          per-renderer basis.
