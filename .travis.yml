  # To install external filter binaries, we first need to install
  # RubyGems and Node/NPM. I'm not sure why, since it seems clear
  # that NVM and RVM are pre-installed (see below).
  - sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
  - sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:chris-lea/node.js
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get install rubygems
  - sudo npm install -g postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer

  # These are useful for debugging this mess.
  #- env
  #- gem env
  #- rvm info

  # Use non-http registry? https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs/issues/876
  # Without this, installing doesn't work.  
  - sudo npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/

  # Now install the external filter binaries, finally. 
  # If we use sudo for this, ruby gems will not work: it seems they are
  # then installed globally, but are then searched for in a RVM location.
  # (Clearing GEM_HOME might be a way to fix this, if sudo where necessary).
