        Since releases aren't exactly happening on a regular schedule, you are
        encouraged to use the latest code. ``webassets`` is pretty well tested,
        so as long as the build status icon above remains a reassuring green,
        you shouldn't run into any trouble.

        You can `download a tarball`__ of the development version, or
        install it via ``pip install webassets[dev]``.


Development:
        For development, to run all the tests, you need to have at least Java 7
        installed (required for example to run the `Google closure`_ filter).

        1. Install Python requirements (preferable in a virtual env)::

                   $ pip install -r requirements-dev.pip
                   $ pip install -r requirements-dev-2.x.pip

        2. Install other requirements::

                   $ ./requirements-dev.sh

        3. Run the tests::

                   ./run_tests.sh
