0.8 (2012-11-23)
    A major change in this release is the removal of the ``django_assets``
    module. The django integration has moved to a separate project:
    https://github.com/miracle2k/django-assets
    See the "Upgrading" section in the documentation for more
    information; you'll also find other backwards-incomatible changes there.

    - Support for a multi-directory load path. See the
      ``Environment.append_path()`` method.
    - Compiler-style filters will now automatically run in debug mode.
    - New filters: cleancss, css_slimmer, stylus, spritemapper,
      jinja2, typescript
    - Various filters have received improvements, including: coffeescript,
      less, compass, pyscss, jst
    - The bundled copy of ``jsmin`` has been removed for licensing reasons.
    - Various improvements to the documentation (much work still required).
    - Improve standalone usage of the ``webassets`` command line script. For
      example, the command line can now load YAML files.
    - Added a new JSON manifest implementation (Krzysztof Tarnowski).
    - Bundles now support an ``extra`` dict that is made available by the
      template tags, usuable for arbitrary custom data.
    - Various API finetuning (Bundle.build, inheritance of the ``debug=``
      flag, ``auto_build`` behaviour). See the "Upgrading" section in the
      documentation for more information on this.
    - ExternalTool base class to make writing filters easier.
    - Speed up loading of external URLs via 304 support.
    - New "pull external" feature: allows bundles to include any absolute path.
    - Official PyPy support.

0.7.1 (2012-05-31)
    - Fixed: "watch" command was broken with single file in multiple bundles.
    - Fixed an issue with input()/open() filter application.
    - Let pyramid_webassets support asset specifications (Kai Kroner).

0.7 (2012-04-11)
    The big new thing is an abstract "version" concept, which allows the
    version of an asset, in form of a hash or timestamp, to be added the the
    filename or appended to the URL. Manifest functionality has been added to
    allow these versions to be used in production without accessing the source
    files. This is also important for performance reasons.

    In addition, some of the changes that have been made are:

    - CoffeeScript: Support COFFEE_NO_BARE option (Maxim Bodyansky).
    - UglifyJS filter: Now supports UGLIFYJS_EXTRA_ARGS setting (Bryan Chow).
    - Various Sass filter improvements (partially by Simon Pantzare).
    - Switched the less filter to the NodeJS implementation. The old Ruby
      implementation can be used via the less_ruby filter.
    - cssrewrite filter now works with Django's staticfiles, Flask's blueprints.
    - Added filter that compiles Django templates.
    - Added PyScss filter.
    - Added Handlebars filter.
    - Added DustJS filter.
    - Added a datauri filter.
    - Various fixes and improvements for JST filter.
    - Works again on Windows (Jon Morton).
    - Output directory is now auto-created if necessary.
    - Fixed various issues where the updater did not pick up changes, mostly
      when dependencies changed.
    - CLI: Renamed the "rebuild command to "build". Now supports custom
      output files. Now requires argparse or Python 2.7.
    - Added a --no-cache option to the build command.
    - YAMLLoader improvements: now supports custom options, recursive bundles
      (Bradley Wright).
    - Filters are now more powerful via the new open() and concat() methods.
    - FilesystemCache uses md5 values again.
    - Support Python 2.5 again.

0.6 (2011-10-03)
    - The Django 1.3 staticfiles contrib app is now supported.
    - Bundles may now contain URLs (as supported by urllib2).
    - Support for recursive globbing using the python-glob2 package.
    - Support for Javascript templates via a new "jst" filter
      (Lucas Hrabovsky).
    - "watch" command no longer crashes if a build fails.
    - Added a "check" command (Ross McFarland).
    - Bundles now support dependencies - files that are observed
      for the purposes of automatic rebuilding, but are not part
      of the build as far as webassets is concerned (for example,
      Sass include files).
    - Improved Sass filter:
        - No longer include debug info while in production.
        - Use the webassets cache if possible.
        - Allow to be used as an output filter.
    - Java-based filters: Expose stdout messages.
    - Added new rJSmin filter, which ships with the module.
      Deprecated the shipped jsmin module. The jsmin filter will
      require an external dependency in the future.
    - Added UglifyJS filter.
    - Fixed the gzip filter.
    - Made the Compass filter more reliable.
    - Allow container bundles to pass filters to children.
    - The cache is now enabled in production mode as well (by
      default).

      Poitrey).

      ``assets.py`` file (by David Guaraglia).

    - Globbing support: Patterns may not be used when specifying
      Bundle contents.

0.4 (2010-08-21)
    - Renamed project to ``webassets``, no longer Django specific;
      instead, the Django app is an optional addon.
    - With the change to ``webassets``, a bunch of new things are
      included which now make sense, like loading from YAML files.
