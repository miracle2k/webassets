Asset management for Django
***************************

Assets are defined inline in templates:

    {% load assets %}
    {% assets filter="jsmin" output="packed.js" common/file1.js common/file2.js cadmin/file3.js %}
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ ASSET_URL }}"></script>
    {% endassets %}

Apart from any number of source files, the following keyword-like
arguments can be passed to the template tag:

 * output:
     Name/path of the output file. All source files will be merged and the
     result stored at this location.

 * filter:
     The filter to apply to the merged file. Currently, the following filters
     are supported:
	    * jsmin
		* jspacker
		* csstidy
		* cssutils
		* yui_js
		* yui_css
		* gzip
		* cssrewrite
	 If the filter argument is missing, none will be applied (merge only).
	 Multiple filters are supported as well (separate with commas).

Note that all filenames/paths must be relative to MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT.

The templatetag will usually render it's contents once for the final output
file, but can output links to the unmodified source file themselves (see the
ASSETS_DEBUG setting). All urls are prefixed with MEDIA_URL.

--------------------
How assets are built
--------------------

Assets can be updated automatically, or built manually using a management
command.

By default, if the filesystem modification date of any of the source files
exceeds the target file's, the target will be recreated. This behaviour can
be disabled or changed using the ASSETS_UPDATER setting.

The management command for a manual rebuild is used like this:

	./manage.py assets rebuild --parse-templates

This will go through all the templates in your project and tries to find all
assets you have in use. It will then create or recreate them.

--------------------------
Rewriting CSS relative url
--------------------------

If your output file is stored at a path different from any of the original
source file, relative URLs within CSS will likely become invalid. To avoid
this, apply the "cssrewrite" filter which will fix url() instructions.

--------
Settings
--------

ASSETS_DEBUG can be used to switch off or modify asset functionality during
debugging. Apart from False, supported values "nomerge" and "nofilter", the
latter only disabling the application of filters, the former causing the
unmodified source files to be given out.
You can make the value of this dependent on your DEBUG setting.

ASSETS_UPDATER modifies the auto-rebuild behaviour. By default, this is set
to "timestamp", e.g. assets will be updated when a change can be determined
via the filesystem modification dates. Currently, the only other usuable
values are "always" and "never", the former only recommended during debugging,
the latter useful if you want to limit yourself to manual building.

ASSETS_EXPIRE is needed if you send your assets to the client using a far
future expires header. Unless set to False, it will modify the asset url
using it's modification timestamp, so that browsers will reload the file
when necessary. Possible values are "querystring" (asset.js?1212592199) and
"filename" (asset.1212592199.js). The latter might work better with certain
proxies or exotic browers, but will require you to rewrite those modified
filenames via your webserver.

Future TODOs
------------

 * Maybe an alternative way to define assets within Python might make sense
   after all, e.g. say assets.register() calls, by convention in app/assets.py.

 * Automatically create (and delete, i.e. manage) symlinks to make the
   ASSETS_EXPIRE="filename" option work without server rewrites.

 * Support functionality for applying a filter directly within a template, i.e.
   pack inline scripts; also, if the output argument to {%assets%} is missing,
   the result could be piped directly into the template.

 * Should be provide features for normalizing encodings?

 * Handle far future expires for images: add a new templatetag that can output
   image urls with timestamps; the cssrewrite filter could modify urls within
   CSS files when ASSETS_EXPIRE is enabled.

Bugs:

 * Nodes in child templates are always not correctly found by rebuild command?
 * Add autocreate option to disable automatic creation even if not exists (
   source files are outputted instead)
